# Data Engineering Assessment

## Overview
This project provides an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solution using AWS services. It enables the processing of CSV data files uploaded to an S3 bucket, transforming the data, and loading it into an RDS MySQL database. It is built using AWS Lambda, Terraform, and various Python libraries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- AWS CLI configured with your account
- Terraform installed
- Serverless Framework installed

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/data-engineering-assessment.git
cd data-engineering-assessment
```

### Setup Environment Variables
Run the following command to configure your environment variables:
```bash
bash set_aws_env.sh
```

## Usage

### Makefile Commands
The Makefile defines various tasks for deploying the application and managing the infrastructure.

- **Configure Environment Variables:**  
  `make env` - Runs the `set_aws_env.sh` script.

- **Check Environment Variables:**  
  `make check` - Verifies if all necessary environment variables are set.

- **Initialize Terraform:**  
  `make terraform-init` - Initializes Terraform.

- **Plan Terraform Infrastructure:**  
  `make terraform-plan` - Creates an execution plan for Terraform.

- **Apply Terraform Infrastructure:**  
  `make terraform-apply` - Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the infrastructure.

- **Capture Terraform Output:**  
  `make capture-tf-output` - Captures outputs from Terraform.

- **Deploy Serverless Application:**  
  `make sls-deploy` - Deploys the Serverless application.

- **Clean Up Infrastructure:**  
  `make clean` - Destroys the Terraform-managed infrastructure and removes the Serverless application.

### Uploading Data
To upload CSV files to S3:
```bash
bash upload_to_s3.sh path/to/your/file.csv
```
